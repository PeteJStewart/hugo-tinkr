Optimisation can be applied to every aspect of website development and maintenance, including work-flow, testing, front-end and back-end development.

There was a time when optimisation was rarely thought about.

We'd make our website all singing and dancing and put them online for everyone to enjoy.

There was also a time when images didn't get a second thought either, but then came Mosaic web browser and suddenly the internet had inline images!

Things change, and with web development it changes increasingly fast. Mobile devices have played their part in the increased need to optimise website, as we now use responsive design to create websites that fit all screen sizes.

If this isn't done responsibly, your mobile users may leave your site before it has properly loaded and therefore loose you custom.

Optimisation can be applied to every aspect of website development and maintenance, including the work-flow, testing, front-end and back-end development.

Even meeting and management can be improved using lean and agile project management.

Optimisation is something I'm very passionate about, and believe it should be thought about right from the start of a project, rather than an afterthought.

Unfortunately we don't always have that luxury, as many project have evolved over time and need optimising to better fit their surroundings.

So whether you're at the begging of a new and exciting project, or you're revamping a legacy system, I'm always happy to hear from you.
