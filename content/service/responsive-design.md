With mobile devices here to stay, responsive design is a must! Having worked with mobile for over 10 years, I start every projects mobile first and work up from there.

For many years I've needed to explain what responsive design is, and why it's necessary.  Fortunately this rarely the case these days.  In most cases now, if your website isn’t already responsive, you’re more likely to be approaching me to help make it responding, rather than asking me to explain what responsive design is.

In short, responsive design allows web pages to respond to device and screen size, changing layout of page content to enable optimum viewing experience.

For a more detailed explanation, read my article on the finer points of responsive design.

Whether you have a project that is in need of a responsive design, or you have a responsive design that is in need of improvement, I’m sure I can help out.

Drop me an email for a quick chat.
