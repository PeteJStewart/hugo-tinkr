Digital consultancy can play a key part in the development cycle, especially in the early planning stages. Consultancy can also be beneficial to established projects.

I've advised many companies and organisation on the best ways to approach projects and tools and systems to use during the development and for future maintenance.

It's in this role that I often feel I am most effective on a project.

As with many years experience working on digital development projects, I can often predict issues that may arise and suggest ways of avoiding them.

I also find it valuable to run ideas past expert consultants to check you're on the right path. I've often done it myself over the years and never regretted it!
